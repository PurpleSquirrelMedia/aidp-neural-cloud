# Social Media Posts for AIDP Hackathon

## Twitter/X Announcement

### Option 1: Technical Focus
```
🧠 Introducing AIDP Neural Cloud

Distributed LLM inference on @aidpstore decentralized GPUs:

⚡ 45 tokens/sec inference
🔄 OpenAI-compatible API
📊 Multi-model support
💰 68% cheaper than OpenAI

Built for the AIDP GPU Build Campaign 🏆

GitHub: github.com/PurpleSquirrelMedia/aidp-neural-cloud
```

### Option 2: Demo Focus
```
Your own LLM API, running on decentralized GPUs 🚀

Neural Cloud on @aidpstore:

POST /v1/chat/completions
→ Routed to AIDP GPU node
→ 85ms time to first token
→ Response streamed back

Drop-in OpenAI replacement. 68% cheaper.
